## Final project for the Digital Shapers #codeathome program from TechLabs.

# The project idea must be submitted until the 29/09/2020 and the project must be submited by the 31/10/2020. 

The overall subject of the codeathome Project is:
# Living in the new normal. 

This project was developed as a solution to solve one of the major issues with the constantly changing information on covid-19 - the lack of a platform for users to get updated information on another country situation. This is specially valuable if someone has to travel to another country but doesn't know the rules applying there. 



# (If later we want to develop a mobile app, we need to pay attention to some important points)(https://youtu.be/tGYGSnbld9s) 
    * width and height need to work on mobile
    * there must be an ever-present navigation bar (a way to always go back) 
    * to follow links to external domains, add "_blank" target to open in a new tab
> There is an app template at github.com/jamesonsaunders/Convert-Website-to-App that we can use (change src attribute on homepage iframe to our website; input our app name, ID, icon; build the app and test it)
