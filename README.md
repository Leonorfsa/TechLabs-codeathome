# Final project for the Digital Shapers #codeathome program from TechLabs with the theme "Living in the new normal"

This project was developed as a solution to solve one of the major issues with the constantly changing information on covid-19 - the lack of a platform for users to get updated information on another country situation. This is specially valuable if someone has to travel to another country but doesn't know the rules applying there. 

## Project Description
### Project name
Pandemic Nomad

### Problem statement
The project idea is based on the lack of a platform to provide travelers with correct, up-to-date information on traveling conditions in each country. As each country has very specific rules when it comes to covid (obligation to do a covid test, having to wear a mask,....), the lack of a platform that puts together all that information in one place is a necessity that should be addressed.

### Solution pitch
Our project focuses on putting together all information on Covid-19 for travelers that want to visit a country and want to know what rules are implemented there depending on the departure country. For the pilot version we will only focus on some example countries, which can be chosen via a dynamical dropdown menu. The information will be shown as a table with sorted categories and external links. In addition an interactive map with information links and a contact form are implemented. The contact form could for example be utilized by the user to send important information and a request to update our database with specified information.

### Impact
The “Pandemic Nomad” can have an enormous impact in today’s world, as information regarding the pandemic is constantly changing in each country. In most cases the needed information is only updated in each country’s national language on a locally known website, but lacks informative data in a readable format for visitors to that country, for example in a general language, like english. With this in mind, a solution that puts together the updated information for each country simplifies the work the traveler (or travelling agency, or even a hotel to provide specific services to their customers) has to do in order to safely travel to another region/country, ensuring that the traveler takes into account all the required measures to safely travel and avoid spreading / getting the Covid-19. We believe that this website could be a suitable addition to the tools already existing with regard to Covid-19 information.
